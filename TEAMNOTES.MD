# Team Notes

## Event Badge Requirements:


## Meeting Notes:

### Meeting Date 11/4

#### What we did:
We started the third and final project and choose to do the event badge.

#### What we'll do next
Our next steps are to complete Check-In 1 as a group. Then individually watch the first three of your videos from this project's playlist, and write our 9th blog post all by Sunday at midnight.

## Status Check-Ins:

### Check-in 1
What project/issue you picked(link to it):
- Event Badge: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/607

A hand-drawn/computer sketch/XD/some annotation visually of what needs to be done or what pieces get broken out. This could be drawn over the top of a screenshot of the item or a photo of whiteboard sketches. Whatever makes the most sense to you.
- 

Initial questions/unknowns:
- How do we wire our element to Hax?
- Can we take creative liberties with the design of our event badges that aren't a part of the comp?

What elements do you expect are needed for this design?
- Badge Header
- Badge Footer
- Image
- Badge

What properties do you expect these to have?
- CSS Styling
- Padding
- Color Variations
- Icon Changablily 
- Changing of the individuals information

Slots?
- I believe we will definitely need to use slots to make the different parts of the project work currently as they will need to be flexible.

What CSS/Styling unknowns are there presently?
- We don't know yet but will probably come up with some as the project progresses.

What states does it have? can you click/hover to engage with it?
- We could possibly have hover states that change the look of the badge, but we will decide this for 100% later on in the project.

What properties need to be mapped to HAX/the storybook? What can the user interact with?
- The user with need to be able to change the badge holder information, image, as well as the different color variations for the different elements within the badge.
